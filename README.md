# Posture-Correction-and-Analysis

This is a project that is done during the Final year of Btech. Information Technology. 

It Analyses User's posture through hardware and give alerts and statistics for Posture correction. 

Our code for Posture Correction and Analysis is partitioned into to smaller sections; Software Part and Hardware Part. 

Initially user login and register where users can input their details and register in the system. 

Users can use their username and password to login to the system.

then analysing posture by continuously monitoring data from the hardware through android application. 

it is followed by Analysing and showing  result according to valuation of data from the hardware.

We used Android Studio and Arduino IDE for testing and ran the final code in Android Studio and Arduino IDE itself.
